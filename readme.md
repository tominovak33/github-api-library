## Instructions 

* create a constants/constants.php file (copy the example one and change the details)

* create a ../commands folder - this is where the script will write the commands for things like backups (which you can either run manually or set up a cron to at specific times)

* tweak the index.php file to do the things you need and then run it either form the command line or from browser
